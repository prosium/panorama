## Brief Description
Panorama is a web-based database for evaluating somatic mutation in cancer. 

The Panorama presents a continually updated analysis of all available cancer proteogenomic or multiomics data from many papers and consortiums including TCGA, CPTAC, or PCAWG. 

Currently, Panorama 1.0 includes cancer data from 10,110 samples, covering 19 cancer types across 11 tissues.
